# Pro Clean Melbourne


## About 
Procleaners is a published mock cleaning business website that I designed and developed independently. It is a business that provides cleaning services for domestic and commercial purposes. Similar to my other mock websites, BEM methodology and SCSS was utilised simultaneously with React-Router and React Icons in order to successfully publish this project.

## Built with 
To create this Project I used React, JS, HTML and SCSS, coupled with React-Router to create a multi-paged website.
